# The Theos Documentation

VERSION 1.

As written by **Daniel Ferreira (theiostream)**.

Impossible to have been made without the people:

* Dustin Howett -> Theos, #theos, always commenting on obscure features.
* Jay Freeman -> irc.saurik.com
* Max Shavrick -> Teaching me of Theos' existence.

And the documents:

* The Make Manual, by the GNU Project
* "Chapter 1. Makefiles", by Dustin Howett
